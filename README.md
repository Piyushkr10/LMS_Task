Project Overview
The Learning Management System (LMS) is a full-stack web application designed to manage courses, track student progress, create quizzes, and allow admin users to manage content. It enables both students and administrators to interact with the system, providing an interactive, scalable, and secure platform for managing online learning.

Features
User Authentication: Login and registration system for both students and admins.
Course Management: Admins can upload course content (videos, PDFs) and manage course details.
Progress Tracking: Students can track their progress on each course.
Quiz Management: Admins can create quizzes; students can take them, and results are tracked.
Email Notifications: Sends notifications for various activities like registration, quiz results, etc.
Responsive UI: Built with React.js to ensure a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
Technologies Used
Frontend:
React.js - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React Router - For managing routing and navigation.
Axios - For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
CSS - Custom stylesheets for the frontend UI.
Backend:
Node.js - JavaScript runtime for the backend.
Express.js - A framework for building RESTful APIs.
MongoDB - A NoSQL database used for storing data.
Mongoose - ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB.
JWT (JSON Web Token) - For secure user authentication and authorization.
Nodemailer - For sending email notifications.
Installation Guide
1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the project repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/lms.git
cd lms
2. Backend Setup
Step 1: Navigate to the backend directory
bash
Copy
Edit
cd backend
Step 2: Install the required dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root of the backend folder and add the following variables:

env
Copy
Edit
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_app_password
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/lms
PORT=5000
JWT_SECRET: Set a secret key used to sign and verify JWT tokens.
EMAIL_USER: Your email address used to send notifications.
EMAIL_PASS: The app password generated for your email (if using Gmail).
MONGODB_URI: The URI to connect to your MongoDB database.
PORT: Port number for your backend server (default 5000).
Step 4: Start the Backend Server
bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev
This will start the backend server on http://localhost:5000.

3. Frontend Setup
Step 1: Navigate to the frontend directory
bash
Copy
Edit
cd frontend
Step 2: Install the required dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Step 3: Start the Frontend Server
bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
This will start the frontend server on http://localhost:3000.

Challenges and Solutions
1. Authentication with JWT:
Challenge: Ensuring secure login and token management.
Solution: Implemented JWT tokens for user authentication. On login, the server sends a token to the client, which stores it in localStorage. The token is included in the header of each request to verify the user's identity.
2. CORS Issues:
Challenge: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues when the frontend tried to access the backend.
Solution: Configured the backend to accept requests from the frontend by setting appropriate CORS headers.
3. File Uploads:
Challenge: Handling large files (videos, PDFs) for course content.
Solution: Used Multer middleware to handle file uploads in the backend. Files are stored either locally or in cloud services like AWS S3.
4. Email Notifications:
Challenge: Sending emails via Gmail with two-factor authentication enabled.
Solution: Used Google App Passwords for secure email sending through Nodemailer.
